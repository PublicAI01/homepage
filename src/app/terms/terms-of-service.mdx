## DISPUTE RESOLUTION

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

Agreement to Arbitrate:

Any disputes or claims between you and PublicAI will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, not court, except you may assert individual claims in small claims court. You and PublicAI are each waiving the right to a trial by jury.

Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions:

YOU AND PUBLICAI AGREE THAT CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. The arbitrator may not consolidate multiple parties' claims or preside over any class proceeding.

Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:

Before arbitration, contact [support@publicai.io](mailto:support@publicai.io) to resolve disputes amicably. Send a written Notice of Dispute to [support@publicai.io](mailto:support@publicai.io). If unresolved within 60 days, either party may commence arbitration.

Arbitration Procedures:

Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information, visit https://www.adr.org and https://www.adr.org/consumer.

The arbitrator must follow these Terms provisions. Unless parties agree otherwise, hearings will be in a reasonably convenient location.

Costs of Arbitration:

Arbitration Fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided.

Confidentiality:

All aspects of arbitration proceedings, rulings, decisions, and awards will be strictly confidential.

Severability:

If any term of this Arbitration Agreement (except "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions") is invalid, parties agree to replace it with a valid term closest to the original intention. If "Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions" is found invalid, the entire Arbitration Agreement is null and void (unless solely invalid for public injunctive relief claims).

Future Changes:

If PublicAI makes future changes to this Arbitration Agreement (except Notice Address), you may reject changes by sending written notice within 30 days to [support@publicai.io](mailto:support@publicai.io). By rejecting, you agree to arbitrate under the version in effect when you first accepted these Terms.

## GOVERNING LAW

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding conflict of laws principles. Any arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with these Terms.

## CORRECTIONS

The Site may contain errors, inaccuracies, or omissions. We reserve the right to correct any errors and update information at any time without notice. PublicAI does not warrant that content will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful items.

## MISCELLANEOUS

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and PublicAI. Our failure to enforce any right or provision does not waive that right. We may assign rights and obligations to others at any time. We are not liable for losses caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If any provision is unlawful or unenforceable, it is severable and does not affect other provisions. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship is created. You waive defenses based on electronic form or lack of signing.
