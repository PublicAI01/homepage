      <p>
        Consumers have the right to request the deletion of personal information
        we have collected from them. However, the CCPA allows us to retain
        information in certain circumstances (e.g., legal obligations, specific
        exceptions outlined by the CCPA).
      </p>

      <h3>5. How to Exercise Access and Deletion Rights</h3>
      <p>
        Consumers can submit requests for accessing or deleting their personal
        information by accessing and reviewing personal information associated
        with your account by contacting us via{' '}
        <Link href={`mailto:${SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS}`}>
          {SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS}
        </Link>
        .
      </p>

      <p>
        For security purposes, we will verify your identity before fulfilling
        your request. If you have an account with us, we may verify your
        identity by having you log in. If you don&apos;t have an account, we may
        need to contact you or request additional information (such as your
        name, email address, or telephone number) to verify your identity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once your identity is verified, we will respond to your request to the
        extent permitted by law. If we&apos;re unable to verify your identity,
        we may ask for more information or deny your request. If we can&apos;t
        fulfill your request completely, we will provide you with further
        details explaining why.Please note that certain personal information may
        be exempt from these requests under applicable law. Additionally, we
        require certain types of personal information to provide our products
        and services. If you request deletion of such information, you may no
        longer be able to access or use our products and services.
      </p>

      <h3>6. The Right to Nondiscrimination</h3>
      <p>
        Consumers have the right to be free from discrimination for exercising
        their CCPA rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not deny, charge different prices for, or provide a different
        level of quality of goods or services with respect to Consumers who
        choose to exercise their CCPA rights.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Authorized Agents</h3>

        If you designate an agent to make CCPA requests on your behalf, we will
        verify both your identity and your agent&apos;s authorization to act on
        your behalf. We may request a signed written authorization or a copy of
        a power of attorney to verify the agent&apos;s authority.
      </p>

        If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United
        Kingdom, or Switzerland, you have certain rights and protections under
        the law regarding the processing of your personal data, and this section
        applies to you.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
      <p>
        When we process your personal data, we will do so in reliance on the
        following lawful bases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g.,
          processing payments for and providing the products and services you
          requested).
        </li>
        <li>
          When we have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data to
          operate our business or protect our interests (e.g., to provide,
          maintain, and improve our products and services, conduct data
          analytics, and communicate with you).
        </li>
        <li>

          your consents and track those who have opted out of communications).
        </li>
        <li>
          When we have your consent to do so (e.g., when you opt in to receive
          communications from us). When consent is the legal basis for our
          processing your personal data, you may withdraw such consent at any
          time.

      </ul>

        business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other
        compliance obligations.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Data Subject Requests</h3>
      <p>

        the personal data we hold about you and to receive your data in a
        portable format, the right to ask that your personal data be corrected
        or erased, and the right to object to, or request that we restrict,
        certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights,
