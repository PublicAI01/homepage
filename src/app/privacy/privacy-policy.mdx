## DE-IDENTIFICATION AND DATA PROCESSING FOR AI TRAINING

De-identification Processing:

Before using any User-Uploaded Data (including Training Data) for AI model training purposes, we implement de-identification, anonymization, or aggregation techniques to protect user privacy. All user-contributed content used for AI training undergoes de-identification processing to ensure it cannot be traced back to specific individuals.

Our de-identification measures include:

- Removing or masking personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, and other direct identifiers
- Applying aggregation and statistical techniques to prevent re-identification
- Implementing technical safeguards to separate user identity from training data

While we employ these measures to protect your privacy, please note that no de-identification method is absolutely foolproof. We continuously update our techniques to align with industry best practices and applicable data protection standards.
