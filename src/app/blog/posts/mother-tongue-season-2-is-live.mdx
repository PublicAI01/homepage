We’re back with **Season 2** of our global Mother Tongue campaign and this time, it’s bigger, louder, and paying out more ways to contribute.

🎙 Speak it. Upload it. Verify it.

## Here’s how to earn:

🔊 **Record your voice**

Head to the **Upload** tab in the Data Hub. If you’ve taken the language quiz and set your **language and location** in your profile, you’re good to go. Maximize your earnings by recording up to 240 phrases every day. Claim your rewards once the samples are accepted through the voting process. Track your accepted submissions on the Missions page and progress towards big payouts at 1, 10, 50, and 100 hours fully accepted!

✅ **Vote on recordings**

Top contributors aren’t just speakers — they’re verifiers too. Use the **Vote** tab to help us keep data quality sharp. You get a prize for voting, whether you say the thing is good or bad. But you only get the prize if you vote the same as others. Be honest, or you might lose points!

💸 **Earn bonuses**

Hit milestone targets in recording tasks to unlock bonus payouts. And for the **top 100 most active, high-rep voters**? We’re splitting **$1300** across the leaderboard.

Because this is your voice. Your data. Your language.

And when communities speak, PublicAI listens.
