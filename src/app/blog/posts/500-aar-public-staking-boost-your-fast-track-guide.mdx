**The Human Layer is about to go turbo.** At TGE, $PUBLIC staking will open, and for a limited launch window, early stakers will get a **500% AAR boost**. That’s 60x the normal yearly rewards, designed to thank the first wave who commit at TGE and help secure the network from day one.

This boost won’t last long. Stake during the window, lock in your multiplier, and start earning more while supporting the mission to build AI that works for humans.

## **What’s the 500% AAR Boost?**

AAR stands for **Annualized Average Return,** basically, the rate you’d earn if those rewards ran for a full year. With this boost, you’ll earn **60x times the normal rate** during our launch window.

The boost runs for a limited time right after staking opens. Anyone who stakes $PUBLIC during this period — meeting the minimum stake amount — will lock in the higher rate for the boost duration.

**Example:** If the regular AAR is 20%, a 500% boost means you’d earn as if it were 100% for that period. Stake 1,000 $PUBLIC and your boosted rewards could be 5x higher than normal.

## How to Stake & Claim the Boost

When staking opens at TGE, follow these steps to lock in your **500% AAR**:

**Step 1:** Connect your supported NEAR/BNB wallet to the staking dashboard.

**Step 2:** Enter the amount of $PUBLIC you want to stake (must meet the minimum).

**Step 3:** Confirm the transaction and lock in your stake — your boost is now active.

**Step 4:** Track your boosted rewards in real time through your dashboard.

The earlier you complete these steps during the launch window, the longer you’ll earn at the boosted rate.

## **Why Stake Early?**

**Maximize your rewards**: The 500% AAR boost only applies during the launch window. The sooner you stake, the longer you earn at the boosted rate.

**Put your $PUBLIC to work:** Early staking means your tokens start generating rewards right away instead of sitting idle.

**Strengthen the Human Layer of AI:** Your stake helps secure the network and fuel PublicAI’s mission to build AI that works for humans.

## Unstake Anytime

You’re in control. You can request to unstake your $PUBLIC at any time. Once you do, there’s a **14-day cooldown** before your principal is returned (no interest is earned during that cooldown period).

## Understand the Risks

Staking can be rewarding, but it’s not without risk. Token values can go up or down, and network conditions may change.

Always review the staking terms and make sure you comply with local regulations before committing your $PUBLIC.
