## The Human-Powered Breakthrough That Will Finally Make AI Smart

Artificial General Intelligence won’t be built on scale alone. It demands something harder: **better data, fairer ecosystems, and sharper evaluations.**

That’s the vision of the **2077AI Open Source Foundation**, a global initiative advancing AGI through open-source benchmarks, sustainable infrastructure, and a thriving AI innovation ecosystem. Their work includes benchmarks for document parsing, logical rigor, graduate-level reasoning, and real-world agent performance — setting the standards that define AI’s next frontier.

Now, **PublicAI** is joining the mission alongside visionary institutions including Harvard, Stanford, MIT — and through the launch of **Project EVA**, the world’s boldest attempt yet to test AI’s ultimate limits.

## Project EVA: A $10.24M Global Challenge

The $10.24M Project EVA (Evaluate AI) competition challenges the world’s brightest minds — “Reality Architects” — to push today’s most advanced AI models to their breaking point. Instead of solving problems, participants will design novel, adversarial challenges that expose the failure modes, blind spots, and reasoning limits of AI.

Because the truth is clear: traditional benchmarks are no longer enough. If we want AI capable of serving humanity, we must test it in ways as complex, creative, and unpredictable as humanity itself.

## Strategic Partners

- **RemoExperts** provides the official registration and talent hub, building the new home for elite AI innovators.
- **Abaka AI** joins as co-organizer, supplying technical infrastructure and expertise.
- **PublicAI** powers the Human Layer, mobilizing real people to source the culturally nuanced, human-verified data.

We’ve spent years building the Human Layer of AI: decentralized data infrastructure powered by 3M+ contributors across 200+ countries. By compensating experts to provide authentic, human-verified data, PublicAI delivers the one input AGI can’t fake, and that’s the human experience.

Together, this collaboration means:

- **High-quality training inputs.** PublicAI’s global contributor base complements 2077AI’s datasets like **Matrix** (bilingual pre-training) and **PIN** (multimodal learning), grounding them in cultural nuance and lived expertise.
- **Stronger evaluation.** PublicAI will help source “hard questions” from real users to sharpen benchmarks like **KOR-Bench** and **SuperGPQA**, exposing AI’s blind spots where it matters most.
- **Sustainable ecosystems.** By aligning incentives and rewarding contributors, PublicAI extends 2077AI’s vision of a sustainable, human-centered innovation cycle.

## Raising the Ceiling of AI

This partnership isn’t about incremental gains. It’s about building the foundations for AI that doesn’t just compute faster, but understands deeper.

**PublicAI brings the human layer. Abaka AI brings the engine. 2077AI brings the vision.**

Together, through Project EVA, we move closer to AI that isn’t just more powerful, it’s more human.
