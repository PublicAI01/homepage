San Francisco-based “Web3-powered ScaleAI” — PublicAI has secured **$10 million** in funding to build the human layer of AI, enabling everyone worldwide to join and earn by contributing data to train AI and participating in human-in-the-loop AI inference. The fundraising event comprises a $8 million Series A invested by Saudi Telecom Group, Blockchain Builders Fund, Tykhe Blocks Ventures, NEAR Foundation, Taisu Ventures, MH Ventures, YGG, CSP DAO, IBC Group, G20, Whitewater Labs, and UXLink, following an initial **$2 million** raise from IOBC Capital, Foresight Ventures, and the Solana Foundation. PublicAI is also incubated by the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, a program based in Palo Alto, CA, that exclusively supports companies founded by Stanford graduates building at the frontier of blockchain technology.

As AI drives job displacement, PublicAI offers a way for everyone to stay involved and earn in the AI economy. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) isn’t just for AI training — it’s increasingly essential during the inference stage, where AI makes real-world decisions. As AI replaces routine jobs, humans must shift into higher-value roles alongside it. PublicAI is building a decentralized human layer for inference, enabling people to validate, review, and guide AI outputs in real time. This new role is independent from training data — it’s about keeping humans meaningfully in the loop through the AI-caused job crisis.

As concerns grow around AI models being trained on synthetic data, [a recent study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y) published in _Nature_ confirms that AI models trained on AI-generated synthetic data experience performance collapse, highlighting the limitations of relying on AI-generated outputs for future model training. In response to this growing concern, PublicAI has rapidly emerged as a leader in Human-in-the-loop (HITL), generating over $14 million in client revenue and building a global workforce of 1 million contributors. By focusing on real, verified data, PublicAI ensures AI systems remain accurate, diverse, and grounded in human truth.

Expanding its vision even further, PublicAI will launch HeadCap, the world’s first decentralized brainwave data collection device, to drive next-generation brain–computer interface (BCI) development._“PublicAI’s groundbreaking approach to human-powered data collection with fair compensation is setting a new standard in the AI industry. We are thrilled to support their visionary leadership in this sector.”_ Gil Rosen said, Managing Partner at Blockchain Builders Fund and President of the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator. _“At PublicAI, our mission is clear: harness human expertise to train ethical, reliable, and impactful AI,”_ said Kenji Narushima, co-founder of PublicAI. _“Our ultimate goal is empowering individuals globally, enabling everyone to share the economic upside of AI innovation. We’re just getting started, and we’re excited to have visionary partners with us on this journey”._
