## A Proven Track Record, Not Promises

PublicAI exists to flip the script on today’s AI economy, where a few tech giants control the flow of data and dictate who benefits. Our protocol creates an open, on-chain system where contributors are fairly compensated, and AI models are trained on verified, high-quality human intelligence, not scraped or stolen data.

With over 2.9 million contributors worldwide already powering the network, this token sale is the next step in expanding community ownership of PublicAI’s infrastructure so that the people building AI are the ones who truly share in its value.

Our platform proves a sustainable model, not crypto speculation. The $PUBLIC token features revenue-driven issuance: new tokens are minted only when enterprise clients pay for data services. This 1:1 backing ensures every token represents actual economic value.

## The Future We’re Building

As AI displaces traditional jobs, PublicAI creates new earning opportunities by keeping humans essential in the AI pipeline. Contributors across 200+ countries are already earning above local wages by providing the intelligence that powers next-generation AI systems.

This token sale represents a critical step toward decentralizing AI’s foundation layer, ensuring that the people providing the intelligence behind AI systems own a piece of the future they’re helping to build.

_“PublicAI’s vision for decentralized data monetization resonates deeply with NEAR’s mission of open web infrastructure. They’re setting a new standard for how communities can own and profit from their data.”_

- Cameron Dennis, Head of Partnerships @ NEAR AI
