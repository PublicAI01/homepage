Data doesn’t flow without trust.

That’s why we’re teaming up with [Nexus](https://nexus.xyz/) — a purpose-built Layer 1 for verified computation — to bring **privacy-preserving data contributions** to the forefront of AI development.

Together, we’re merging two visions:

- PublicAI’s community-powered data economy where contributors earn real revenue,
- and Nexus’s cutting-edge **zkVM**, enabling confidential, on-chain compute.

The result? **A secure, scalable pipeline for trusted AI.**

# Why it matters

AI’s having a feast on your data, mined in silence, baked into black-box models.

PublicAI flips the script:

- Over **800,000 global contributors**
- More than **$11M in dataset sales**
- And a clear promise: **Experts get paid. Clients get smarter.**

Now we’re adding another layer: **zero-knowledge privacy**.

# What we’re building together

This partnership unlocks a new class of AI-native workflows on the Nexus chain:

- **Private Data Contributions** Using zkVM to share anonymized, verifiable data for training and evaluation — no leaks, no guesswork.
- **Decentralized Model Validation** Verified computation ensures your AI’s outputs are accurate, auditable, and above board.
- **Scalable dApp Infrastructure** Feed AI into DeFi, DePIN, and analytics use cases with trusted, traceable inputs.
- **Interoperable Ecosystems** Seamless value and data exchange across PublicAI and Nexus, creating richer AI economies in Web3.

# From testnet to takeoff

We’re kicking off with testnet integrations, embedding PublicAI’s data contribution flows directly into the Nexus developer environment. This gives builders a sandbox to explore **privacy-first AI** that’s transparent by default, not as an afterthought.

And we’re going deeper: **PublicAI is now an official member of the Nexus AI Lab** — a cross-ecosystem initiative driving innovation at the intersection of decentralized compute and intelligent systems. Together, we’ll shape the infrastructure, workflows, and primitives needed to build the next generation of ethical, verifiable AI.

And this is just the start. Expect joint campaigns, dev activations, and contributor rewards as we expand the frontier of ethical AI.

**AI needs better data. Better data needs better rails.**
