The crypto space is under attack — again. If you’ve been in Web3 long enough, you’ve probably seen it: a DM from an “official” account on Telegram or X (formerly Twitter), urgently warning that **your account has been compromised.** They send you a link to “secure” it. One click, and boom — your credentials are gone, your accounts hijacked, and your project becomes the next domino to fall.

# The Playbook: How They Get You

These phishing attacks aren’t just some amateur scams — they’re **sophisticated, high-level social engineering tactics** that have hit even the smartest players in the space. Here’s how it works:

1.  **Fake Alerts** — You get a message from someone pretending to be an official support team.
2.  **Sense of Urgency** — They tell you your account has been hacked and needs immediate action.
3.  **Spoofed Links** — They send you a **near-identical** but fake login page for X, Telegram, or your crypto wallets.
4.  **Credential Theft** — You log in, thinking you’re securing your account. In reality, you just **handed over your keys**.
5.  **Takeover & Chaos** — Your compromised account is used to spread the scam, drain funds, and disrupt projects.

# Who’s Behind It?

Some of these attacks have been linked to **Lazarus Group**, North Korea’s infamous cybercrime syndicate, responsible for some of the **largest crypto hacks in history.** Their biggest hits include:

- **$1.5B Bybit Exchange Heist (2025)** — The biggest crypto hack ever.
- **$625M Ronin Network Breach (2022)** — A social engineering attack that nearly killed Axie Infinity.
- **Countless Project Takeovers** — From wallets to Web3 startups, they’ve left a trail of destruction.

# Why Are They Targeting You?

Because **your project has value.** Whether it’s funds, influence, or community trust, they want to **weaponize your credibility** to push their next scam.

# How to Protect Yourself & Your Community

✅ **NEVER click on links from unsolicited DMs.** If you didn’t request help, it’s probably a scam. ✅ **ALWAYS verify the sender.** Check usernames, account creation dates, and previous posts. ✅ **Enable 2FA everywhere.** And use hardware keys for critical accounts. ✅ **Educate your team & community.** Make security awareness a part of your culture.

Web3 isn’t for the weak. **Stay paranoid, stay secure, and don’t be the next victim.** 🏛️🧠
