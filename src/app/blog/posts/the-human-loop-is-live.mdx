### Build & Earn Before MTS6.

$2,400 in prizes on the table.

We’re launching a connected campaign that turns:

DataBabies NFTs into earned PUBLIC. MEXC holders into Raffle Ticket earners. Social Engagement into fuel for the entire system.

Four engines. One loop.

Stake → Earn → Hold → Amplify → Repeat.

👉 The loop is live. Position accordingly.

### TLDR

- Stake DataBabies NFTs on HotCraft to earn from a 35,000 pool of PUBLIC.

- Hold $5+ PUBLIC on MEXC and upload daily proof on DataHub to earn raffle tickets.

- Compete in our ROVA Video Challenge for a chance to win from a $400 USDC prize pool.

- Join the MEXC Hero Challenge on Datahub to claim an extra Raffle Ticket.

### Why the Loop Matters

Holding PUBLIC is not passive.

It’s your gateway to AI infrastructure. It validates your contribution to the Human Layer. It proves you’re participating in the network enterprises are already paying for.

- **First move:** hold PUBLIC on MEXC. Your raffle tickets scale with the number of days you hold. The sooner you hold and show proof the more tickets you will earn.

- **Second move:** activate your 1x bonus by joining the Hero challenge.

We reward action. The multi-engine campaign is designed for it.
