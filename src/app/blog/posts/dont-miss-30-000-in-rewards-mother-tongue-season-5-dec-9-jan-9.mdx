## What is Mother Tongue Season 5?

Mother Tongue is a campaign on PublicAI’s Data Hub, where you get paid to record your voice speaking your native language.

**Season 5 runs:** December 9, 2025 — January 9, 2026

**Total rewards:** $30,000+ USDT Pool (paid on BNB Chain)

Every voice matters. But not every voice gets paid for shaping the future of AI. Mother Tongue changes that — PublicAI’s global voice-data campaign where real people teach AI to listen, understand, and respect the world’s languages.

### How do I earn money?

You earn money by recording short audio clips in your language. PublicAI pays you for clean, verified voice data.

**Bonus:** You also earn $5 for every friend who joins the campaign after you refer them!

### What languages can I record?

Season 5 accepts recordings in these 12 languages:

- Indonesian
- English
- Russian
- Mandarin
- Arabic
- Italian
- Korean
- Japanese
- French
- Spanish
- Thai
- German

**Speakers from anywhere in the world are welcome!** Even if you don’t live in the country where your language is spoken, you can still participate.

### Why is honesty important?

**Be honest about:**

- Your primary native language
- Other languages you speak
- Where you are from
- Your accent or dialect

**Why this matters:** Labels like “Mexican Spanish” or “British English” or “Indonesian with Javanese accent” help AI learn better. Different accents and dialects are valuable data.

The Member Survey collects this information, and judges will verify your accent/dialect labels. Honest participation creates better AI.

### What do I need to participate?

To join Mother Tongue Season 5, you need:

1. **Complete the Member Survey** (required — be honest about your language background)
2. **Stake 100 $PUBLIC** tokens on BNB Chain
3. Record audio samples in your native language
4. Wait for verification to unlock daily USDT rewards
5. Earn $5 for every friend you refer

Simple steps. Real rewards. Real impact.

### What makes Season 5 different?

Season 5 improvements include:

- **Better verification** — Judges verify your accent and dialect labels
- **Live tracking** — New dashboards show your progress in real-time
- **12 major languages** — Focused collection across key global languages
- **Skip bad prompts** — You can now skip text that doesn’t make sense or can’t be pronounced
- **$30,000 reward pool** — Larger rewards than previous seasons
- **Improved Member Survey** — Ensures honest, high-quality data collection

Season 5 prioritizes quality. If you see text that’s awkward, unnatural, or impossible to pronounce correctly, skip it. We want your natural voice, not forced readings.

### Who can participate?

Anyone who:

- Speaks one of the 12 languages fluently as their mother tongue
- Can record clear audio samples
- Has 100 $PUBLIC tokens to stake
- Completes the Member Survey honestly

**All accents and dialects welcome!** Your unique voice pattern is valuable.

### Why does my accent matter?

AI needs to learn from **diverse voices**:

- Different regional accents
- Different dialects
- Different age groups
- Different speaking styles

When you honestly label your accent (like “Spanish from Argentina” or “English from Nigeria”), you help create AI that works for everyone, not just one standard accent.

### Why is this important?

Most AI learns from limited voice data that doesn’t represent real people. Mother Tongue builds the **world’s largest community-driven voice dataset** where:

- Contributors give **consent**
- Contributors get **paid fairly**
- AI learns from **real human diversity**
- Honest labels create better AI models

Your participation helps create AI that reflects actual human speech patterns across different regions and accents.

### Why does PublicAI pay for voice data?

Most AI voice data comes from two sources:

- **Scraped data** (taken without permission)
- **Synthetic data** (computer-generated, not real voices)

PublicAI proves real human voices create better AI. When you record with PublicAI, you give **consent** and get **paid fairly** for your contribution.

**Our clients build cutting-edge AI systems** that need to understand real people. They trust PublicAI to provide high-quality, consent-based voice data.

### What happens with my voice recordings?

Your voice recordings train the most advanced AI systems that clients use for:

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** — Converting speech to text accurately
- **Speech-to-Text (STT) systems** — Transcription services and voice assistants
- **Voice AI and conversational AI** — Chatbots and virtual assistants
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — Understanding human language
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems** — Accessibility tools for people with disabilities
- **Multilingual AI models** — Products that work across languages and regions
- **Dialect and accent recognition** — AI that understands regional speech patterns

PublicAI clients build advanced AI products that need to understand real people — not just synthetic voices or scraped data. Your voice helps create AI that works for everyone.
