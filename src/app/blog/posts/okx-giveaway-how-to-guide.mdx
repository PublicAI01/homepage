**Step 1: Complete any Quiz to get a badge on the Solana chain**

Now for the more challenging tasks!

- Login to the [PublicAI Data Hub](https://beta.publicai.io/) with your OKX Wallet.
- If you are new to PublicAI you should take a minute to complete your user profile by heading to the Missions tab. You will need at least 150 Points to finish the tasks ahead of you here.
- Start by binding your Email, X and SOL accounts.
- **Make sure that the SOL account that you bind is THE SAME ONE in your OKX Wallet! This is either the default SOL account, or an account you’ve imported. If it’s different, you might have trouble verifying when you complete the Quests.**

Now for your first task:

**Complete any Quiz**

Let’s start with our “_Discover PublicAI_” Quiz. You will see it when you click _Quiz_ in the main navigation panel on the left in the Data Hub.

Click “Start” and complete the Quiz!

Once you’ve clicked “Ok” you can now collect your Badge via the Solana Chain when you click the “ON-CHAIN” button on the Quiz section. See below.

Once you’ve confirmed the transaction in your wallet (yes, you will need a small amount of $SOL in order to complete the transaction for the network fee, it’s usually around 0.00009 SOL) the box should say “VIEW ON-CHAIN RECORDS” and that means you’ve completed the task!

_Important: Remember that you want to claim your Badge with the same SOL account that is bound to your profile and in your OKX Wallet!_

**Step 2: Complete One Data Upload!**

On the navigation panel click on “Upload” and make sure you’re viewing the Live Upload challenges.

Once you’ve hit “Start Task” you’ll get a Popup. Click “Apply to Start” and you’re ready to go!

_Important: You need to have 100+ followers on your bound X account to participate. If you don’t, you can try any other available Quiz & Upload task._

Head to the “Vote” tab and click “Go” on the Community Hero Challenge box and you’re ready to Vote. Make sure to read over the criteria and requirements for voting in detail before you begin.

You will need to Stake 150 Points to start. Don’t have points? Well, you should if you completed Missions first!

Now, click the button to proceed with Voting!

**Important:** Trust your judgment. You will be rewarded when your vote matches the majority of other voters. So, review carefully and vote honestly!

_With the X Post featured below, what would you vote?_

You can Vote on up to 1,000 submissions per day, but for the purpose of this campaign just vote once, then return to OKX and refresh the Quest. You should see a Green Check next to it to show you’ve completed it properly. If you don’t then maybe you’ve missed something. Go back and double check everything and try again!
