There are a number of ways to bridge your tokens and participate in the $PUBLIC Token Sale on CoinList.

> Please by advised that CoinList only accepts (Ethereum Network ERC-20) USDT or USDC for token purchases.

For this example we will be focusing on the HOT Wallet Mobile App using Intents:

## Step 1

If you haven’t already downloaded, installed, and imported your preferred account into HOT wallet, you can get the app on [Playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.herewallet.hot&pcampaignid=web_share) or [Apple](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hot-wallet/id6740916148) and get yourself set up.

We highly recommend that you use the same Near Account that you bound to your PublicAI profile. If you’re not sure which one that is, go check your profile first, then import that account into HOT wallet.

Once you’ve entered the private keys of the account you want to import, choose the MPC option (usually it’s the default). This allows you to do cross-chain swaps from within the HOT app by using the Bridge and connect to CoinList to participate.

## Step 2

Once you’ve connected your account and see your funds in the wallet you can click on Bridge from the Home menu.

There, you can select where the funds will be coming from. In the demo below we are moving $NEAR from NEAR to $USDT on Ethereum.

Keep in mind that there is a 0.003 NEAR network fee (approx $0.30) and you will need to have that, along with the minimum 0.2 Near in your account to cover the bridge fee and internal account storage.

**NEXT:** Make sure to have at least $1 worth of ETH in your account so that you can safely cover the gas cost for your purchase transaction. If you don’t already have ETH you can do the same as before and use the bridge. We advice you bridge a minimum of 0.5 NEAR to be safe.

## Step 3

When you go to CoinList to purchase $PUBLIC you can connect your HOT wallet using the ETH network (where your newly bridged USDT/USDC is) and proceed with your purchase.

Please be reminded that there is a $100 minimum to participate in the token sale. So, make sure that you bridge enough the first time so you don’t need to do it again.

## Pro Tip: Bind Your Wallet

Have you bound your Near Wallet to your PublicAI account yet? If you’re participating in our Token Sale (or expecting an airdrop in the future) now is the time to do it!

Why? After you make your purchase of $PUBLIC on CoinList you will need to connect your Near wallet to receive your purchase should you be approved for the sale.

## Final Note:

Allocations are competitive and based on the order and amount of purchase requests, meaning not everyone who participates is guaranteed tokens.

CoinList allocates tokens based on a method called the “Filling from the Bottom” allocation method. **See our article about this** [**here**](https://blog.coinlist.co/filling-up-from-the-bottom-a-new-mechanism-for-allocating-tokens/)**.**

If you are not selected to receive an allocation, your funds will be refunded to your CoinList Wallet, usually within 48 hours to 5 business days after the sale ends. You will be informed of your final allocation within that same time frame after the sale closes.

**Secure your allocation now!**
