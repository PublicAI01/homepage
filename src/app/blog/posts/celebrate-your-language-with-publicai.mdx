## How to Get Involved👩💻

We are starting with [Data Hub](https://beta.publicai.io/) tasks covering 11 languages: Chinese, English, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Thai, German, Italian, French, Russian and Arabic. Ready to lend your voice and expertise? Here’s how:

1️⃣**Fill out this form** meticulously to secure your spot in our campaign: [PublicAI Survey: Language Skills Check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeETf6XLOde0pQFj7lHriqTTNP1LsduyfEVUVehwDSPfv0ZuQ/viewform). Don’t see your mother tongue listed? Fill it in under “Other”, even if it’s not a well known language. Diversity and niche expertise are what we value the most! Your detailed input will ensure that your language is portrayed with the depth it deserves.

2️⃣**Upload Your Voice:** Record audio in your native language — the one you’ve spoken since birth. We’re after clear, natural, high-quality samples to train AI. Check out our video below for a step-by-step guide. If your language isn’t available now it will be soon!

3️⃣**Vote and Earn:** Our new voting mechanism lets you rate others’ recordings. Judge the quality — clarity, flow, volume — not the content. Stake points to vote, agree with other judges, and score rewards when your votes align.
