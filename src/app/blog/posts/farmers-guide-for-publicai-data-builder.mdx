**TLDR;**

- **Make your social media profile look real:** Add a photo, bio, and personal details so you don’t seem like a bot—people report those less.
- Post smart, not spammy: **Edit AI replies to sound like you,** share personal thoughts, and don’t overdo it (keep it under 10 posts a day).
- Stay safe and keep earning: If X bans you, **use PublicAI with email or crypto logins** to keep going with uploads, votes, and referrals!

Hi #ai3 Data Builders! This guide helps you support projects like PublicAI on social media without catching heat. We’ll show you how to look human, post smart, and keep earning, even if things go wrong. Let’s make the future of #ai3, #desci, and #crypto more human and fair together!

## Why This Matters

Centralized platforms like X can ban us for no reason. They control our accounts, and that can mess up our lives. To stay safe, turn on multiple login options (like email or crypto wallets: SOL, NEAR, BNB/ETH) on sites like [beta.publicai.io](https://beta.publicai.io). This way, if X bans you, you can still access PublicAI and keep earning!

AI3, DeSci, and crypto are important for a fair future. They let everyone join in, no matter where you’re from. PublicAI believes in this too—we want all 750,000+ Data Builders to bring their whole selves to the network. Being your true self online also keeps your accounts safe and helps you get the most out of social media.

## Why Are #ai3 Farmers Getting Banned?

Some PublicAI users got suspended on X, but it’s not because X is targeting us. X doesn’t have enough staff or tools to ban specific Dapps or Data Hunter AI Reply users. Most of our users are fine—only a few got banned.

Here’s what’s happening: some X users report #ai3 members for looking like spam bots. This happens when we post too many promotional replies, like saying “Great post! Join PublicAI!” too often. Other users don’t like that, so they report us. It’s not X—it’s user-on-user conflict. To fix this, we need to act more human and post in a way that doesn’t look like spam.

## Step 1: Make Your Profile Look Human

Bots often have empty profiles, so let’s make yours look real and fun!

- Add a profile picture, like your favorite NFT or a photo of something you love.
- Set a header image (maybe a cool design or a favorite place).
- Add a location, even if it’s a fun one (like “Hogwarts” or “Gotham City”).
- Write a bio that shows who you are. Not sure what to say? Use a quote you like, like “Live long and prosper!”
- Share your hobbies or interests, like gaming, cooking, or books.

Your profile is like digital fashion—it shows you’re a real person with passions. This makes other users less likely to report you.

## Step 2: Post Like a Human, Not a Bot

Posting on social media can be hard, especially when you don’t know what to say. PublicAI’s Data Hunter AI Reply helps! It gives you a starting reply for any post. But don’t just copy-paste; make it your own. Here’s how to post in a way that feels real and won’t get you reported:

- **Edit the AI Reply:** Look at the AI reply. Does it sound like you? If it feels fake or cheesy, change it. Add your own words, style, or language (like your [mother tongue](https://publicai.io/blog/celebrate-your-language-with-publicai)).
- **Be Personal:** Share your own story or experience. For example, if the post is about AI, say, “This reminds me of how AI helped me learn English!” Or share a meme or idea that fits.
- **Use Names and Tags:** Mention the original poster or tag friends who might like the post. For example, “Hey @username, this made me think of you!”
- **Match the Tone:** Would you talk like the AI reply in real life? If not, change it. You can also reply in the poster’s language—use AI translation tools to help!
- **Say Thank You:** If the post helps you, thank the author. For example, “Thanks for this tip—it helped me with my work!”
- **Ask Questions:** Make your reply start a conversation. For example, “How do you think AI will change jobs in the future?” or “What if we had more data like this—how would it help?”

## Step 3: Share Your #ai3 Excitement the Right Way

We all love #ai3, but we don’t want to look like spam. Here’s how to share your passion without getting reported:

- Don’t just say, “Join PublicAI!” Instead, talk about why you love it. For example, “I love how PublicAI lets me earn by sharing my voice—how do you think free data can help AI grow?”
- Tie it to the post. If the post is about jobs, say, “This makes me think of how PublicAI helps freelancers earn in the global economy!”
- Ask big questions about AI and web3. For example, “How can diverse data make AI better for everyone?” This invites others to talk, not report you.

The golden rule: make replies that start conversations, not just statements.

## Step 4: Don’t Over-Post

Studies show most people post less than 1 reply a day on social media. Even with AI tools, posting more than 10 replies a day looks unusual. To stay safe, keep your replies under 10 a day. This makes you look more human and less like a bot.

## Step 5: What If You Still Get Reported?

Sometimes, you might still get reported—it can happen to anyone! A suspension on X is not the end. It’s temporary, not permanent (unless your account is deactivated). X is understaffed, so it might take time to get your account back. Don’t lose hope!

- Read X’s [guide on suspensions](https://help.x.com/en/managing-your-account/suspended-x-accounts) to understand what’s happening
- [Request a copy of your personal data](https://help.x.com/en/forms/privacy) from X to prove you’re a real human.
- Even though it's slow, [file multiple appeals with X](https://help.x.com/en/forms/account-access/appeals/redirect).

While you wait, you can still earn with PublicAI! Visit [beta.publicai.io](https://beta.publicai.io) to do missions, upload data, or vote to increase your reputation. Keep going—you’ve got this!

## Final Tip: Keep Earning with PublicAI

Social media is just one way to support PublicAI. You can also earn by:

- Logging into [beta.publicai.io](https://beta.publicai.io) with email or crypto wallets.
- Doing Data Hub tasks like voting or recording audio in your native language.
- Keeping your browser open after logging into Data Hunter.

Good luck, have fun, and let’s build a better future together! 🏛️🧠
