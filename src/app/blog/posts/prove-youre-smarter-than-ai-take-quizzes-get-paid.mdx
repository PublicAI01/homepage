# Introducing Quizzes on PublicAI

The internet is full of people who know their stuff — about crypto, climate science, anime, K-pop, or chicken farming. Until now, there wasn’t an easy way to prove it and get rewarded.

That just changed.

PublicAI’s new **Quiz feature** lets you showcase your smarts in niche topics and contribute to training better AI models at the same time. Whether you’re a die-hard DeFi degen, legal eagle, or language nerd — there’s now a way for you to turn that deep knowledge into token rewards.

# How It Works

- **Pick a Topic.** Browse available datasets in the Data Hub. Each one has multiple-choice quizzes based on real-world content. Choose one that matches your domain.
- **Answer Questions.** Pick a dataset that matches your domain — crypto, medicine, anime, whatever you’re into. Every day, each quiz has a fresh batch of 10 questions to show what you know.
- **Be Real.** We introduced this feature to get to know you better, so you’ll get points whether your answers are right or wrong. If you try to research the answer by switching tabs, the quiz closes instantly. Fair is fair.
- **Earn with Expertise.** Top performers in each area of expertise will unlock exclusive earning opportunities on the PublicAI Data Hub. Don’t waste your change with random clicks!

# Why This Matters

Every AI model is only as good as the data it learns from. And that data? It doesn’t appear out of thin air — it comes from humans. People with judgment. People with insight. People like you.

At PublicAI, we’re building a system where **real contributors shape the future of intelligence**. That means no click farms, no bots, no lazy scraping. It means elevating the voices that deserve to train tomorrow’s AI.

The **Quiz** is your way in. It’s how you prove you understand what makes content meaningful — and that you’re ready to contribute to a system designed to reflect **humanity, not just noise**.

High-quality contributors create high-quality data. And that’s what leads to **better, safer, more aligned AI**.
