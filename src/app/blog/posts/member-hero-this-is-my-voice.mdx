That’s it!
Say it proudly, clearly, and with your own style.

## How to Record

1. **Hold your phone upright** (vertical/portrait mode).
2. **Stand in one place, don’t walk around**
3. **Good light** — near a window or outside.
4. **Choose a nice simple background, not too busy or distracting**
5. **No Noise!** Find a quiet place to record, we need to hear your clearly!
6. **Look at the camera and smile.**
7. Wait 2 seconds before and after you speak.
8. **Speak naturally** and say _“This is my voice. This is PublicAI.”_
9. **Join the Campaign \* Upload your video** → [https://beta.publicai.io/](https://beta.publicai.io/)

_Tips: Get a friend to hold the phone or use a tripod to limit movement. Don’t cover the mic with your finger or hand! Oh, and don’t say “_(pause)_” when you record ok!_
