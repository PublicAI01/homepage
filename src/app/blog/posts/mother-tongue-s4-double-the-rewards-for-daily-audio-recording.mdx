## Mother Tongue is back with double the rewards and double the impact

Mother Tongue is back. Season 4 (MTS4) brings new mechanics that don’t just refine our process — they redefine how the entire DataHub works moving forward.

This isn’t just another campaign. It’s a system upgrade.

**TL;DR — How to Join MTS4**

- To **upload**, you must stake **100 PUBLIC** (28-day lock).
- **Speak clearly** — AI checks are stricter, so quality matters.
- **Rewards in USDT**, amount depends on language.
- Only **Judges can vote**. Uploaders focus on clean recordings.
- You can **switch languages anytime**, but doing so **forfeits any unclaimed rewards**.
- **Read the rules carefully before you start** — mistakes can cost your stake.
- **Not signed up? Act fast and complete our onboarding application to participate:** [https://publicai.typeform.com/onboarding](https://publicai.typeform.com/onboarding)

## What’s New in MTS4

### Staking to Upload

- To upload, contributors now stake **PUBLIC.** (NEAR supported for now)
- Malicious activity = ban + **100% stake slashed**. (Minor mistakes can still be resolved manually)
- Stakes are locked for **28 days**.

### Audio Submissions

- Our AI detection got sharper.
- Speak clearly, at a steady pace, with good volume.
- Expect uploads to take longer (10–20 audios won’t be as quick as before).

### Language Settings

- You can now change your language directly in your profile.
- If you’re active in a live campaign (like MTS4), language stays locked until it ends.

### Voting Updates

- Only Judges can vote.

### Rewards

- Rewards continue in **USDT**.
- Different languages, different rewards.

### Referrals

- The referral system is being redesigned. It’s hidden for now.

### Dashboard Updates

- Your dashboard now reflects both **$PUBLIC stakes** and **USDT rewards** for uploads.

### Updated Rules for Uploads

✅ Find a quiet spot with no background noise (no fans, pets, traffic, or other people talking).

✅ Wait 1 second after hitting “start” to be sure the recording is working.

✅ Speak casually, as if you’re talking to a friend, with clear pronunciation and energy.

✅ Read the words exactly as they appear, without repeating or omitting any words.

✅ Press “stop” after reading the phrase.

✅ Play the recording to confirm it’s clear and complete.

✅ Hit “skip” if the recording is bad or words are cut off, submitting bad recordings will decrease your reputation.

❌ Do NOT repeat the phrase multiple times.

❌ Do NOT use TTS or AI voice generation or your account will be banned.

### MTS4 Languages

English (for Standard, Indian & Pinoy accents), French, Spanish, Mandarin, Italian, Thai, Indonesian, Russian, Arabic (Modern Standard), German, Korean, Japanese.

## Why This Matters

MTS4 isn’t just about more recordings. It’s about **raising the quality bar**, protecting the integrity of the data, and rewarding contributors who do the work right.

Experts win. Clients win. That’s the PublicAI model.
