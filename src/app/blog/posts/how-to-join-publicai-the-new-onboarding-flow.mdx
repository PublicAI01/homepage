The Human Layer of AI is growing fast. If you’re already part of PublicAI, you have the privilege of logging in and continuing to earn. And whether you’re an old user or brand new, you can **take advantage of referrals** as a way to earn rewards while helping PublicAI grow.

For new applicants, we’re rolling out a **structured onboarding process**. This isn’t like we used to do it with instant sign-ups. We’re intentional about who we bring in, and the process reflects that. Here’s what to expect.

Sign Up — [https://beta.publicai.io/](https://beta.publicai.io/)

## What we look for (and how to stand out)

We review every application carefully. The single biggest signal is **substance:** clear, specific answers that show who you are and how you’ll contribute.

- **Be detailed.** We ask for your name, contact info, location, background (LinkedIn/CV, education, skills, hobbies), and **why you want to join**. Use this to paint a real picture of what you’ve done, what you’re good at and where you want to help.
- **Context beats buzzwords.** Give examples: projects shipped, roles played, outcomes achieved. Short is fine; **specific** is mandatory.
- **Contribution clarity.** Tell us how you plan to add value (data work, recording audio, research, engineering, content, etc.) and **how much time** you can realistically commit.

## Fast lane: DataBabies holders skip the queue

If you hold a **DataBabies NFT**, you’re prioritized and **skip the waitlist**. Don’t have one yet?

You can pick one up here: [https://hotcraft.art/collection/data-babies.nfts.tg](https://hotcraft.art/collection/data-babies.nfts.tg)

But here’s the catch: in the ‘Enter your wallet’ section (right after ‘What crypto wallets do you have’), make sure you list the wallet that holds your NFT. That’s how we verify and fast-track you.

## Timing, decisions, and updates

- **Review window:** Applications are reviewed in batches; expect a response within **a few weeks at most**.
- **Decisions:** The review team will go through applications and decide on approval or rejection.
- **Priority:** DataBabies holders are prioritized; referrals **do not** affect onboarding order.
- **Next steps:** Accepted applicants will receive an onboarding email with instructions. Rejected applicants will not receive an email.

## Quick prep checklist

- Update your **LinkedIn/CV** so we can verify your background fast.
- Gather **wallet addresses** you already use (NEAR/Solana/EVM) if applicable.
- Reflect on **where you’ll contribute** and **your weekly availability**.
- Review basic **security hygiene**.
- If you want to **skip the queue**, consider getting a **DataBabies NFT**.

If you’re ready to help build the Human Layer of AI and get fairly rewarded for real contribution, submit your application and make it count!
