We just updated the [Consensus Center](https://beta.publicai.io/validator) with a new feature: Campaign Data Verification. This means you can now help check if uploaded data follows the rules — and earn points for it! Let’s break it down step by step so it’s super easy to understand.

## How It Works

### Stake Points to Participate

- You’ll need to “stake” (use) some points to join the verification process.
- The better your past contributions, the fewer points you’ll need to stake.
- If you’ve caused disruptions or uploaded bad data before, you’ll need to stake more points to prove you’re serious.
- Stake is returned as soon as consensus is reached, typically within a few hours.

## Review the Data

- Look at the photos or data someone uploaded.
- Decide if it meets the rules. Don’t worry, we’ll give you clear guidelines.
- **Not sure? No problem!** If a submission has you stumped, take a screenshot and share it in the community on [Telegram](https://t.me/PublicAiNews) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/PublicAI). It’s not cheating — it’s pre-consensus teamwork! You’ll help others learn what makes a good submission while improving your own judgment. Everybody wins. 🙌

Staking is a Commitment to Make Quality Contributions

## Match the Consensus

- **Full Match:** If your decision matches the majority (what most people agree on), you get points as a reward! 🎉
- **Partial Match:** If you’re close but not perfect, you’ll get your staked points back — but no extra rewards.
- **Way Off:** If your decision doesn’t align (more than 50% off), you’ll lose your staked points. Why? Because random clicking or not paying attention adds noise instead of improving AI. We need your focus to add signal!

## Earn Bigger Rewards

- Rewards multiply for high-contribution users! Upload great data, or make smart, majority-approved calls, and your rewards will skyrocket.

## Tips for Tasks

Quality verification starts with quality uploads. Here’s how to keep things smooth and maximize your bags:

- Upload Smartly: You can only upload data 10 times per day, so make sure it’s high quality.
- Avoid Penalties: If you upload bad or irrelevant data three times in a row, your account will be frozen for three days.
- Play Fair: Uploading random, unrelated data repeatedly will get your points cleared and make you ineligible for rewards.
