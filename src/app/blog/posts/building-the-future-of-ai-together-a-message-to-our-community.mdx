**TL;DR:** Our recent TGE marked an important milestone, but we know some community members expected different outcomes. We’re committed to transparency about our distribution criteria and excited about the substantial rewards ahead through our revenue-driven model and 35% treasury allocation for future community benefits.

PublicAI has already proven our commitment by paying out over $20,000 USDT to contributors before TGE, and existing users maintain exclusive DataHub access to continue earning — [join the active Mother Tongue campaign now](https://beta.publicai.io/).

## Transparency in Our Token Distribution

The launch of $PUBLIC represents the foundation of a sustainable, community-driven ecosystem that rewards meaningful participation in shaping AI’s future. We want to address the concerns we’ve heard from our community about the recent airdrop distribution and share our vision for what lies ahead.

## The Numbers Behind Our Distribution

Our airdrop targeted users who demonstrated genuine engagement with PublicAI’s mission. Here’s the full breakdown:

- **Minimum threshold:** 50,000 points (no one below this received tokens)
- **Average recipient points:** 151,000
- **Top contributor:** 16,745,282 points
- **Power users:** 111 community members with over 1M points

However, reaching 50,000 points alone wasn’t sufficient for eligibility. We prioritized contributors who showed meaningful engagement through multiple pathways, ensuring rewards went to those building alongside us rather than passive point collectors.

## Rewarding Genuine Participation

Our distribution criteria focused on users who:

**Earned Real Value with Us**: Contributors who participated in revenue-generating campaigns like CloseUpBoops, Mother Tongue, and Hero — demonstrating their belief in our platform’s ability to deliver tangible rewards.

**Invested in Our Ecosystem**: DataBabies NFT holders who put their own money behind PublicAI’s vision, understanding that reputation and long-term thinking drive sustainable platforms.

**Staked for Governance**: Users actively staking points for voting, showing commitment to participating in our decentralized decision-making process.

These mechanics weren’t designed to exclude, but to ensure our initial token distribution reached hands that would help build a thriving, sustainable ecosystem.

## Recognizing Our Earliest Supporters

We heard your feedback about early contributors, and we took action. An additional **50,000 $PUBLIC tokens** have been distributed to our earliest supporters who earned Guard status — those who’ve contributed consistently across multiple tasks and maintained quality standards over time.

Our three-tier system reflects genuine contribution:

- **Scouts**: All participants earning through our platform
- **Guards**: Multi-campaign contributors with proven quality (eligible for Discord application)
- **Judges**: Exceptional contributors helping ensure data quality standards

This structure ensures our clients receive diverse, high-quality data while creating clear advancement paths for our community.

## The Road Ahead: Why This Is Just the Beginning

## Revenue-Driven Sustainability

Unlike platforms that distribute tokens hoping to create value later, PublicAI has already demonstrated our commitment to paying real rewards. We’ve distributed **over $20,000 USDT** to task participants, proving our model works before TGE.

Our **35% treasury allocation** (350M $PUBLIC tokens) is reserved specifically for future community rewards. This isn’t a one-time distribution, it’s an ongoing commitment tied directly to platform revenue. As we grow, our community grows with us.

## Active Opportunities Right Now

The Mother Tongue campaign is live and accepting contributions. Early supporters maintain priority access to DataHub while new users join our waitlist, a privilege earned through consistent participation.

## Long-Term Vision

PublicAI isn’t built for quick gains but for sustainable value creation. Our revenue-driven token issuance model means:

- **Real demand drives token creation**: New $PUBLIC tokens are minted based on actual platform revenue
- **Sustainable growth**: Token supply increases only when we’re generating real value for clients
- **Community-first benefits**: 35% of all tokens flow back to contributors

## Moving Forward Together

We understand that not everyone received what they expected from this initial distribution. Building a fair, sustainable platform requires difficult decisions about how to allocate limited resources to maximize long-term value for everyone.

What sets PublicAI apart is our commitment to transparent communication and our proven track record of delivering real value. We’re not asking you to trust promises, we’re showing you results through consistent USDT payouts and meaningful platform development.

The future of AI depends on diverse, high-quality human input. Together, we’re defining how humans and AI collaborate in the economy of tomorrow.
