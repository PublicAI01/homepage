We’re excited to announce that PublicAI is officially joining the [Chainlink Build program](https://chain.link/economics/build-program). As a part of Build, will accelerate ecosystem growth and long-term adoption of our AI data platform by gaining enhanced access to Chainlink’s industry-leading oracle services and technical support, as well as incentivizing greater cryptoeconomic security, in exchange for a commitment to provide network fees and other benefits to the Chainlink community and service providers, including stakers.

We’re confident that through enhanced support, secure offchain services, and the backing of Chainlink’s vibrant community, we can accelerate awareness of PublicAI and realize our goal of becoming the world’s largest decentralized AI training data infrastructure.

## PublicAI: Building the Human Layer of AI

PublicAI is transforming the AI landscape by enabling millions of verified contributors worldwide to generate and validate high-quality, human-crafted training data. Through a decentralized platform with skill validation and stake-slashing mechanisms, we ensure data integrity while allowing individuals to monetize their expertise. As AI displaces traditional jobs, PublicAI keeps humans in the loop, not just during training, but also at the inference stage, where real-time human judgment is critical. Addressing growing concerns over synthetic data degradation, PublicAI delivers authentic data that sustains model performance and trustworthiness. With over 3 million global contributors, it’s building the decentralized human layer that powers both AI systems and oracle networks.

## Why We Joined Chainlink Build

PublicAI joined Chainlink Build to maximize the benefits of security and reliability that Chainlink’s oracle infrastructure provides. As part of Build, PublicAI will receive key benefits, including access to the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE) to enable AI-powered oracle use cases such as trust/reputation scores, dynamic risk assessments, and prediction market resolution. PublicAI will also gain access to new Chainlink product alpha and beta releases, among other benefits.

In exchange for these services, PublicAI will make a percentage of its native token supply available to Chainlink service providers, including stakers, over time. These mutually aligned economic incentives enable both communities to support one another.

> “Joining the Chainlink Build program marks a pivotal moment in PublicAI’s mission to build the human layer of AI. By leveraging the Chainlink Runtime Environment, we’re unlocking entirely new possibilities for decentralized AI.”

**About Chainlink**

Chainlink is the industry-standard oracle platform bringing the capital markets onchain and powering the majority of decentralized finance (DeFi). The Chainlink stack provides the essential data, interoperability, compliance, and privacy standards needed to power advanced blockchain use cases for institutional tokenized assets, lending, payments, stablecoins, and more. Since inventing decentralized oracle networks, Chainlink has enabled tens of trillions in transaction value and now secures the vast majority of DeFi.

Many of the world’s largest financial services institutions have also adopted Chainlink’s standards and infrastructure, including Swift, Euroclear, Mastercard, Fidelity International, UBS, ANZ, and top protocols such as Aave, GMX, Lido, and many others. Chainlink leverages a novel fee model where offchain and onchain revenue from enterprise adoption is converted to LINK tokens and stored in a strategic [Chainlink Reserve](https://blog.chain.link/chainlink-reserve-strategic-link-reserve/).

**About PublicAI**

PublicAI is building the Human Layer of AI as decentralized data infrastructure that allows AI models to be trained on real and high-quality human data. With more than 3 million global data contributors and 14 million USD revenue, PublicAI solves the core problem of AI’s insufficient understanding of the world by incentivizing real users to provide and verify data. PublicAI has raised 12M with backers including Solana Foundation and NEAR Foundation. Incubated by Stanford Blockchain Accelerator and InspireU by Saudi Telcom Group, PublicAI is leading a more ethical, inclusive, and human-centered AI future.
