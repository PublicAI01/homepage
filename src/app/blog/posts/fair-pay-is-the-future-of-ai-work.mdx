## The PublicAI Referral Playbook (That Doesn’t Feel Gross)

Let’s be honest: most referral programs are either boring, scammy, or both.
This one’s different.

At PublicAI, referrals aren’t a gimmick. They’re core to how we grow. We’re building the world’s best training data by paying real people for their expertise. That works best when _those people bring in more sharp humans like them._

So if you know researchers, builders, students, creators, or curious weirdos who’d crush AI missions… Send them our way. You’ll earn a cut of whatever they make. And no, we’re not talking pennies. We’re talking long-term passive income.

Here’s how to do it right, without spamming anyone or burning bridges.

## Method 1: The 7 Degrees Strategy (A.K.A. Your Extended Brain Trust)

You don’t need 1,000 followers to win referrals. You just need to map your world.

**Start with 7 people:**

- A friend you respect
- A co-worker who’s curious
- That one nerd in your group chat
- A cousin who reads whitepapers
- A teacher who’d love the mission format
- A student who needs side income
- A neighbor who shares good links

Now imagine _who they know._ That’s your ripple effect. Start small, message intentionally, and give context:

> _“I’m doing these AI missions that pay you for thinking. It’s legit and fun — thought you might like it too.”_

## Method 2: IRL = ROI (Real-Life Referrals)

Digital referrals work. But IRL ones convert _way_ better. Grab coffee with a friend, talk through the platform, show them a mission. Or…

- Host a tiny “AI Missions Jam” in your living room
- Mention it at your coworking space
- Share it in your book club, meetup, or faith group
- Walk someone through the setup in person

When someone _sees_ it in action, they get it. And when they sign up with your link, you get rewarded.

## Method 3: Make Your Content Work for You

Already posting online? Slip in a smart referral drop.

- Add your referral link to your bio or Linktree
- Share a screenshot of a mission you liked and say why
- Record a short video walking through a task

Bonus: every piece of content you post now can quietly earn you income for years.

No hard sell. Just show up and share what you’re learning.

## Method 4: Go Niche, Not Broad

The best referrals come from knowing your niche.

Are you into Web3? Share in a DAO.
Into language? Find a linguist forum.
Work in healthcare? There are missions for that too.

You don’t need to sell strangers. You just need to find your people.
PublicAI is built for niche knowledge — lean into that.

## Method 5: Use the “One Mission = One Invite” Rule

Every time you finish a mission, think: “Who else would’ve loved this?”

Then message them. One at a time. Like a normal human. This keeps it natural. And it’s way more effective than posting the same link 20 times.

## Final Word

If you’re in PublicAI already, you know the value is real. So share it like you mean it and get rewarded when others join the mission.

Better data through fair compensation. Better AI through _you._
