**The Lore**

Born from PublicAI’s mission to make AI data more ethical, human and fun, **DataBabies** is a pixel-chibi NFT collection created for the “Data Builders” community. Inspired by remix culture and Milady-style aesthetics, the collection includes nods to PublicAI’s deeper work, some characters even wear brainwave headsets, teasing the upcoming HeadCap DePin Node presale. Hidden alpha? The backgrounds feature real text from cofounder Dr. Steven Wong’s published AI papers.

**Rarity**

While most of the collection features pixel-text backgrounds, rare NFTs feature full art backgrounds like our honoraries. There are also 10 prismatic rainbow wildcards in the collection which can be redeemed for a custom honorary by collection artist [CEAZE](https://x.com/SauerCrumb). Try your luck with a free mint on July 14th or hunt them in the secondary market!
