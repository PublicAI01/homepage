At PublicAI, we’re leading the way in making it easy, accessible, and rewarding for anyone, anywhere, to contribute to the future of AI. We’re not just building a technology or platform — we’re contributing to the AI economy of tomorrow.

As AI and Telegram Mini-Apps become the latest buzz in Web3, these innovations are transforming how communities interact, learn, and grow within the decentralized ecosystem. The ongoing AI revolution is unlocking new possibilities, and when integrated with Telegram Mini-Apps, it offers unprecedented opportunities for accessibility and engagement. PublicAI is at the forefront of this movement, empowering users to fully explore AI’s potential in Web3.

Earlier this month, we launched our Telegram Mini-App — a cutting-edge model evaluation tool that invites users to engage in interactive AI experiences and contribute to the evolution of AI models through collective intelligence. The debut of the PublicAI Arena is a major milestone in this journey, providing a dynamic space for hands-on testing of advanced AI models, where users can share comments and suggestions.

**We’re excited to announce…**

The PublicAI Arena Campaign — an exciting new initiative that brings together some of the most advanced Web3 AI models to compete and demonstrate their capabilities within our Telegram Mini-App. Through this campaign, we invite Web3 projects to participate in the PublicAI Arena, offering a platform to showcase and rigorously evaluate their crypto models in a real-world setting, gaining valuable insights and exposure to a broader audience.

## Featured Participants

For this campaign, we’ve invited some of the most innovative Web3 AI projects to take part:

- **FLock**: Introducing _Web3 Prof. Grump_, a large language model (LLM) known for its ability to answer any Web3-related question with a sharp, sarcastic wit. This model is sure to provide an entertaining and informative experience for users.
- **Hyperbolic**: Presenting _Llama-3.1–70B-Instruct_, a powerful LLM designed to handle complex instructions with precision and depth. It stands as a formidable competitor in the arena.

## Competing Models

Alongside Web3 Prof. Grump and Llama-3.1–70B-Instruct, two other top-tier LLMs will also be part of the evaluation:

- **Llama-3.1–70B-Instruct-Turbo**: This version offers enhanced speed and efficiency, making it a strong contender in real-time interactions.
- **ChatGPT 4o:** Known for its poetic yet accurate responses, this model is both creative and reliable, adding a unique flavor to the competition.
