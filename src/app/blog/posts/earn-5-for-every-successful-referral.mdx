PublicAI’s new Referral System is live.

![PublicAI’s new Referral System is live](/images/1_VYtU8EreZY20h6S28sWn0A.png)

**Our new referral system live! And it opens a clean, simple way to earn.**

You’ll now receive $5 USDT for every successful referral who completes 140 approved uploads during the Mother Tongue S5 campaign (coming!).

But here’s the part referrers need to understand:

A referral is only active after the new member is approved.

And approval depends on how well they complete the Member Survey.

To help your referrals get approved (and to avoid failed applications), tell them to fill out the survey accurately and truthfully:

- Their current country should match their IP
- Native language + accent/dialect must be correct
- List all languages they genuinely speak
- Submit a clear introduction recording in their native language
- Add at least one social account and wallet address

_Low-quality or inconsistent surveys may lead to denial._

How the new referral system works:

- Share your referral link via Data Hub
- Your friend completes the survey and gets approved
- They join S5 and finish 140 approved uploads
- If they’re among the first 200 successful referrals of the week, you earn $5 USDT
- Rewards paid weekly
- All rewards go to the referrer (you)

Mother Tongue S5 is finally launching (announcement coming!).

If you plan to earn through referrals, now is the time to guide your friends through the survey so they can enter smoothly and start contributing.

Let’s build the future of fair data together.
