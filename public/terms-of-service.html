      PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER
      BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE,
      RESULTING FROM: (A) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE; (B) THE
      COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY

    </p>

    <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
    <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</p>
    <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
    <p>
      This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in
      the Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all
      disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and PublicAI,
      whether arising out of or relating to the Terms (including any alleged
      breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the
      relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively
      through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance
      with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert
      individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further,
      this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to
      the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can,
      if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that,
      by entering into the Terms, you and PublicAI are each waiving the right to
      a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be
      determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized
      Relief
    </h3>
    <p>
      YOU AND PUBLICAI AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER
      ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
      PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU
      AND PUBLICAI AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN
      MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE
      OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING.
      ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND
      DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF
      AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT
      PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND
      THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO
      THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>
      PublicAI is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
      efficiently, and most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the
      user’s satisfaction by emailing user support at support@publicai.io. If
      such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration
      must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of
      Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to PublicAI should be sent to
      support@publicai.io (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the
      nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific
      relief sought. If PublicAI and you do not resolve the claim within sixty
      (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or PublicAI may
      commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of
      any settlement offer made by PublicAI or you will not be disclosed to the
      arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to
      which you or PublicAI is entitled.
    </p>

    <h3>Arbitration Procedures</h3>
    <p>
      Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with
      the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures,
      including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA
      Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the
      AAA, please visit its website,
      <a href="https://www.adr.org">https://www.adr.org</a>. Information about
      the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s
      consumer arbitration page,
      <a href="https://www.adr.org/consumer">https://www.adr.org/consumer</a>.
      If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any
      term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this
      Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that
      the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not
      result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also
      follow the provisions of these Terms of Service as a court would. All
      issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the
      scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless PublicAI and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
      take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due
      consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
      circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
      determination will be made by AAA.
    </p>

    <h3>Costs of Arbitration</h3>
    <p>
      Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively,
      the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless
      otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.
    </p>

    <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
    <p>
      All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or
      award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of
      all parties.
    </p>

    <h3>Severability</h3>
    <p>
      If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
      Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection above titled “Prohibition
      of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above)
      is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or
      provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
      comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
      term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as
      so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
      provisions of subsection above titled “Prohibition of Class and
      Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or
      unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be
      null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
      unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief.
      The remainder of these Terms of Service will continue to apply.
    </p>

    <h3>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</h3>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding any provision in the Terms to the contrary, PublicAI
      agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement
      (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the
      Service, you may reject any such change by sending PublicAI written notice
      within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address
      provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you
      will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of
      this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or
      accepted any subsequent changes to the Terms).
    </p>

    <h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
    <p>
      The Terms are governed by and will be construed under the laws of the
      State of California, excluding its body of law controlling conflict of
      laws. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms shall be conducted
      in accordance with the Term.

      inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or update the information on the

    <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
    <p>
      The Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or
      in respect to the Service constitute the entire agreement and
      understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any
      right or provision of the Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such
      right or provision. The Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by
      law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at
      any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
      delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
      control. If any provision or part of a provision of the Terms is
      determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part
      of the provision is deemed severable from the Terms and does not affect
      the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no
      joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created
      between you and us as a result of the Terms or use of the Service. You
      agree that the Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having
      drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on
      the electronic form of the Terms and the lack of signing by the parties
      hereto to execute the Terms.
